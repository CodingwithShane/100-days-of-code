### Day 1: February 1, 2018 (Example 1)
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I have now started the 100 days of coding and while I can't really make many projects at the moment as I'm still learning the basics (Javascript). I have decided to do what
the creator told me to do and start Free Code Camp from the start. (I already have started it twice but will breeze through the first parts easy.)

**Thoughts:** I hope starting Free Code Camp from the start is the best option. If not then at least I have a refresher course :smile:

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
