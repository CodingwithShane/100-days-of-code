# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2018
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I have now started the 100 days of coding and while I can't really make many projects at the moment as I'm still learning the basics (Javascript). I have decided to do what
the creator told me to do and start Free Code Camp from the start. (I already have started it twice but will breeze through the first parts easy.)

**Thoughts:** I hope starting Free Code Camp from the start is the best option. If not then at least I have a refresher course :smile:

### Day 2: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did more in FreeCodeCamp learning CSS and started JQuery.

**Thoughts**: I thought I done and know all about CSS and it suprised me with what I learnt. Even going through JQuery a second time has given me ideas on what I can use it for.

### Day 3: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished JQuery and started my Tribute Page (again).

**Thoughts**: I worked for 12 hours today in the sun which is new for me so coding was the last thing on my mind however I managed to not watch Netflix and got it done. I tried to redo my tribute page using Bootstrap 4 whereas I did my own html and css with my first one. I think the first one still looks better than my second.

### Day 4: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on my Portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Again after a long 12 hour shift at work, I wasn't really motivated to code but I knew I had to unless I don't mind failing so early in this challenge. When I did start I started work on my portfolio. It's not much at the moment and I spent an hour on it but I may if I have the time and energy to continue on it longer. I'm pretty excited how it looks now and what it will look like after a few more hours on it.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
