# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2018
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I have now started the 100 days of coding and while I can't really make many projects at the moment as I'm still learning the basics (Javascript). I have decided to do what
the creator told me to do and start Free Code Camp from the start. (I already have started it twice but will breeze through the first parts easy.)

**Thoughts:** I hope starting Free Code Camp from the start is the best option. If not then at least I have a refresher course :smile:

### Day 2: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did more in FreeCodeCamp learning CSS and started JQuery.

**Thoughts**: I thought I done and know all about CSS and it suprised me with what I learnt. Even going through JQuery a second time has given me ideas on what I can use it for.

### Day 3: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished JQuery and started my Tribute Page (again).

**Thoughts**: I worked for 12 hours today in the sun which is new for me so coding was the last thing on my mind however I managed to not watch Netflix and got it done. I tried to redo my tribute page using Bootstrap 4 whereas I did my own html and css with my first one. I think the first one still looks better than my second.

### Day 4: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on my Portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Again after a long 12 hour shift at work, I wasn't really motivated to code but I knew I had to unless I don't mind failing so early in this challenge. When I did start I started work on my portfolio. It's not much at the moment and I spent an hour on it but I may if I have the time and energy to continue on it longer. I'm pretty excited how it looks now and what it will look like after a few more hours on it.

### Day 5: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More on my Portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I had to split the time up and had work in between both times to do my portfolio. It's starting to look good. I'm understanding more about more things just by looking up how to do them. I need to look for new pictures though but that will happen in time as well as updating the text.

### Day 6: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished version 1 of my portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I was getting frustrated when I couldn't get the actual portfolio to work where you show web site examples but I managed to get it. Even fixed the nav so it sticks to the same spot. Should be one or two more days on it then it will just be improving it from there on.

### Day 7: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I done the footer and a few other things and ready to submit. I will continue working on it by changing images to be more suited and content but that will be done outside of the 100 days of code challenge time.

### Day 8: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through some of FreeCodeCamp exercises and started on the Javascript section.

**Thoughts** While doing some Javascript lessons I thought of jumping to algorithms which I spent to much time on so went back to Javascript.

### Day 10: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Javascript in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Almost hit 200 points in FreeCodeCamp. Javascript is slow going. Couple of obstacles where I'm not sure what they want however it's minor mistakes on my side so I'm happy with that. I have the basic concepts just not exact code needed.
